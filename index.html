ðŸŒ³The Tulip Tree

    </h1>

<p>
 The tulip tree, <em>Liriodendron tulipifera</em>, is my favorite tree. It is native to the Eastern Deciduous or Carolinian Forest Zone. Because of it's potential to grow to more than 50 m in virgin cove forests of the Appalachian Mountains, often with no limbs until it reaches 25â€“30 m in height, making it a very valuable timber tree but also a supercanopy tree. I will never forget about the fieldtrip where we went to see it with my MFC class but I was terribly hungover that day so I don't have any photos or memories of where it was. I just remember hugging it and feeling better.
